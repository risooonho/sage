 * ProjectBuilder project, to make a Sage framework on OS-X.
   Depends on a SDL framework, which you can get from the SDL
   site.
 * Fix an SDL include to use the proper form, i.e <SDL/SDL.h>
   instead of "SDL.h". However, older version of sdl-config
   seem to incorrectly add the full path for CFLAGS - not
   sure what the solution is.
