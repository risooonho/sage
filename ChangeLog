2006-07-16  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* build_sage.pl, sage/GL.h, sage/sage.h: Rollback 2006-07-15 changes as
	  these do not work on the Mac.

2006-07-15  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* build_sage.pl, sage/GL.h, sage/sage.h: Some fixes related to using
	  SDL's gl header.

2006-07-15  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* build_sage.pl, sage/GL.h, sage/sage.h: Some changes to use SDL's 
	  opengl header instead of the system defined one. This means that we
	  always use function pointers for gl functions to try and preservce
	  binary compatibility between opengl versions.

2006-07-12  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* sage.spec.in: Update for current files. Use ldconfig. Bump version 
	  and interface numbers in prep for release.

	* configure.ac: Add a linux check for GL rather than assuming it will
	  be available

2006-07-11  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* build_sage.pl, sage/sage_fptr.h: Fix bug in regex that did not allow
	  pointer to be returned in function pointers. 

	* build_sage.pl, sage/sage.h: Define APIENTRY if not defined.

2006-06-30  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* build_sage.pl, sage/sage.h: Add guard against __glext_h_ being defined
	  and define it in the header file to stop any system glext.h being 
	  included.

2006-06-30  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* sage/sage.c, sage/sage.h, sage/utility.h, sage/check_extension.c, 
	  sage/undefs.h, sage/sage_fptr.h, sage/glext_sage.h, build_sage.pl:
	  Redo build script to remove hacky workarounds that didn't really work.
	  Removed undefs.h as this was just plain bad. Removed modified glext.h
	  file (glext_sage.h) as these changes are now incorporated within the
	  other code file. sage_fptr.h Contains the funtion pointer prototypes.
	  Removed internal pointer to the GL_EXTENSIONS string as this was also
	  a bad idea.

2006-06-29  Simon Goodall  <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* sage/sage.c, sage/sage.h, sage/utility.h, sage/check_extension.c: Fix
	  bug where loss of context would destroy the extensions string which
	  we stored a pointer too. This resulted in no extensions being found.
	  I imagine this could also cause a crash. Also made sage_init return 0
	  on success and 1 on failure to obtain the extensions string.

	* templates/license: Update year.

	* build_sage.pl: Update build script for the above changes in the 
	  generated files.

2006-03-27  Simon Goodall <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* sage/Makefile.am: Fix some dllwrap usage.

	* configure.ac: Update some autoconf usuage. Bump version number to
	  0.1.2 for release.

	* sage/check_extension.c, sage/header.h, sage/sage.c, sage/sage,h, 
	  sage/sage_glx.c, sage/sage_glx.h, sage/sage_wgl.c, sage/sage_wgl.h,
	  sage/undefs.h, sage/utiliy.h, templates/license: Update copyright
	  years.

	* sage.spec.in: Add man pages to file section. Automatically add 
	  SDL-devel version from configure.

2005-09-22  Simon Goodall <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

2005-09-22  Simon Goodall <sage@simongoodall.co.uk>

	* sage/glext_sage.h, sage/sage.c, sage/sage.h: Update to glext.g ver 29.

   Depends on a SDL framework, which you can get from the SDL
   site.
 * Fix an SDL include to use the proper form, i.e <SDL/SDL.h>
   instead of "SDL.h". However, older version of sdl-config
   seem to incorrectly add the full path for CFLAGS - not
   sure what the solution is.
