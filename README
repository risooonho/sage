Sage is an OpenGL extension library written to make use of SDL's mechanism for enabling OpenGL's extensions.


How To Use

Simply #include the required header for the OpenGL extension. The header name is the same as the name of the OpenGL extension. To use the extensions, first call initialise_EXTENSION_NAME() and check the return value. A value of 1 means that the extension was loaded, a value of 0 means that there was some error.
